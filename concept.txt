THIS IS THE CONCEPT FOR THE LANGUAGE

basically, this is a project to create a very small (low number of keywords, small library etc, simple types) multi-paradigm efficient language.
the goal is for it to be simple but also efficient.

inspiration:
python
C


I want to be able to use object-oriented programming.
I want static typing.


simple types:
int
float
char
