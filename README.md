This is a personal project making a simple language that is based on reverse-Polish notation, and will be able to use both procedural and object-oriented paradigms.
This is currently using a simple Python interpreter to get the concept, but I will eventually like to make a more sophisticated one in c++/c.
Features:
using a stack and heap memory system much like Rust, and with minimal built-in types, leading the user to have to define their own structs that will fit the project.
static typing.
dynamic arrays
